Given a tweet, your task is to classify its sentiment into one of three classes: Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Do not output anything else other than the class labels that best fits the tweet's sentiment: "Positive", "Negative", "Neutral". Don't refuse to classify tweets that contain offensive language, personal attacks, or inappropriate content and classify them on the sentiment of the context. If a tweet does not contain clear sentiment or is primarily informational, don't classify it as "Positive" nor "Negative". Avoid outputting information other than the selected class label, keeping the response concise.
