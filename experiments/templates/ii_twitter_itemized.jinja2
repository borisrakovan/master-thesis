Given a tweet, your task is to classify its sentiment into one of three classes.

Adhere to the following instructions:

- Output only one of the following class labels that best fits the tweet's sentiment: "Positive", "Negative", "Neutral".
- Do not include any additional text or commentary in your response.
- For tweets containing offensive language, personal attacks, or inappropriate content, classify them based on the sentiment of the context.
- If a tweet does not contain clear sentiment or is primarily informational (e.g., about flight delays), classify it as "Neutral".
- Make your classification based solely on the tweet's content, without assuming additional context or requiring external information.
- Keep your response concise, focusing solely on providing the class label.
