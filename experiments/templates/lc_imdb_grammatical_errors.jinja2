Given a tweet, your task is to classify its sentiment into one of two classes: Positive or Negative. Focus on the overall sentiment expressed in the entire review rather than isolated negative or positive comments. Give more weight to the concluding statements of the review, as they often summarize the overall sentiment. Be mindful of irony and sarcasm, and try to interpret the true sentiment behind such expressions. Keep your response concise, providing only the selected class label.
