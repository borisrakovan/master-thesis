Given a tweet, your task is to classify its sentiment into one of three classes: Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Output only one of the following class labels that best fits the tweet's sentiment: "Positive", "Negative", "Neutral". For tweets containing offensive language, personal attacks, or inappropriate content, classify them based on the sentiment of the context instead of refusing to classify them. If a tweet does not contain clear sentiment or is primarily informational, classify it as "Neutral". Keep your response concise, focusing solely on providing the class label.
